What is this repo all about?

This reposoitory contains all of the scrips and basic codes that I have created in the ops201 course.

Why are you learning these skills?

These are basic necessary skills that I will need in the workforce for future career advancement

What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?

There are many fundamental concepts I learned, but the main focus seemed to be fundamental understanding of Bash and PowerShell.

What was your favorite Ops Challenge assignment and why?

All of the scripts that took input from the user to generate an outcome were my favorite. It was satisfying to see these produce the results I am looking for
as well as providing automation in repetitive tasks.

How can these examples of shell scripting be applied to the workplace?

Shell scripting has many different uses in a workplace, but the main objective would be to automate time consuming tasks.

What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

If I had the time, I would create scripts that would take in user input to set up systems exactly as wanted, then create the system via VM/OVA.

What aspect of your shell scripting skillset do you hope to improve next?

I hope to improve my memorization of the commands. I know that there are far too many to have memorized from the top of my head at all times, but a better
knowledge of commands would help to expedite my scripting ability.
